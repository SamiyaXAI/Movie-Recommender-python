Explanation of the code:
Data Loading: Data from two CSV files (u.data and Movie_Id_Titles) is loaded using pd.read_csv(). The first dataset contains user ratings, and the second contains movie titles.

Data Merging: The two datasets are merged on the item_id column, so we can associate movie titles with ratings.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The average rating per movie is calculated using groupby('title')['rating'].mean().
The number of ratings per movie is calculated using groupby('title')['rating'].count().
The data is visualized with histograms and joint plots to understand the distribution of ratings and the number of ratings.
Movie Recommendation System:

A pivot table is created to map users to movies, with ratings as values.
The corrwith() function is used to compute correlations between the ratings of two movies (Star Wars and Liar Liar).
The correlation results are cleaned by dropping NaN values and filtering out movies with fewer than 100 ratings.
Recommendation:

Movies are recommended based on their correlation with the chosen movies. The movies are then sorted by their correlation to determine the most similar ones.
This code forms the foundation of a simple movie recommendation system based on user ratings and movie similarities.
